PROJECT NAME:
High-SEO Blog Writing Flow – High-SEO Content Generation at Scale

==============================================================================
VARIATION 1: SINGLE HIGH-SEO BLOG GENERATOR
(Designed for Any Single Company)
==============================================================================

1. PROJECT EXPLANATION
----------------------
This workflow focuses on depth and quality for a single entity. It is designed for any company that needs a highly researched, professionally structured blog post. Instead of generic AI text, this system acts as a specialized SEO writer. It takes specific inputs—focus keywords, competitor references, and tone—and generates a comprehensive article complete with an SEO-optimized footer, metadata, and table of contents. It ensures that a single brand voice is maintained perfectly throughout the entire piece.

2. WORKFLOW NODE BREAKDOWN
--------------------------
1. Webhook (Trigger)
   - Function: Receives the specific strategy for one company (Keyword, Tone, Description).

2. Edit Fields (Data Prep)
   - Function: Standardizes the input data to ensure the competitor URLs are readable by the AI.

3. AI Agent (Deep Generation)
   - Function: The core processor. It uses a complex prompt chain to write the full blog. It enforces the "Tone of Writing" strictly and formats the output with HTML tags for headings, lists, and the SEO footer.

4. Respond to Webhook
   - Function: Delivers the single, polished blog post back to the user or CMS.

==============================================================================
VARIATION 2: MULTI-COMPANY ENTITY-BASED SYSTEM
(Designed for Scaling Across 12 Brands)
==============================================================================

1. PROJECT EXPLANATION
----------------------
This workflow is an "Entity-Based" engine designed for scale. It solves the problem of managing multiple clients or sub-brands under one roof. The system accepts a master topic but processes it through 12 distinct "Entity Filters." This means if you input a topic like "Cloud Security," the system will simultaneously write 12 different blogs tailored to 12 different company names (entities). It ensures that Brand A gets a blog written in its voice, while Brand B gets a completely different version, all triggered from a single click.

2. WORKFLOW NODE BREAKDOWN
--------------------------
1. Webhook (Trigger)
   - Function: Receives the master topic data and the list of 12 Company Names (Entities).

2. Parallel Branching / Split
   - Function: The scaling mechanism. It splits the workflow into 12 simultaneous execution paths, ensuring no brand waits for another to finish.

3. Google Gemini Chat Models (x12 Entity Nodes)
   - Function: There are 12 separate AI nodes, each assigned to a specific "Entity" (Company).
   - Logic: Each node takes the master topic but applies a strict filter: "Write this for [Company Name] using [Company Tone]." This ensures unique output for every entity.

4. Merge (Consolidation)
   - Function: Collects the 12 completed blogs from the parallel branches.

5. Aggregate
   - Function: Packages the 12 separate blog posts into a single structured file (JSON/CSV) for easy export.

6. Respond to Webhook
   - Function: confirms the successful generation of all 12 entity-based assets.
