PROJECT NAME:
AutoBlog Intelligence – 4-Stage Multi-AI Analysis & Optimization Suite

==============================================================================
1. PROJECT EXPLANATION
==============================================================================

AutoBlog Intelligence is an advanced content engineering system designed to move beyond simple generation into deep analysis and optimization. Unlike standard AI writers that just "create," this suite acts as an intelligent editor, SEO specialist, and writing coach rolled into one.

The core innovation is its "Multi-AI Architecture." The system integrates Google Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT, allowing the user to route specific tasks to the model best suited for the job (e.g., using Gemini for structured SEO analysis vs. Grok for tone detection).

The system operates through four distinct n8n workflows that handle the entire content lifecycle:
1. Ingestion & Deep Analysis (Reading & Auditing)
2. Metadata & Title Optimization (Lightweight SEO Fixes)
3. Full Blog Rewrite (Structural Overhaul)
4. Chatbot Refinement (Micro-Optimizations)

This modular approach allows users to upload raw files (.docx, .html, .txt), receive a granular audit, and then choose to either tweak specific metadata or rewrite the entire piece for maximum SEO impact.

2. WORKFLOW NODE BREAKDOWN (The 4 Stages)
==============================================================================

Below is the technical breakdown of the four interconnected workflows that power the suite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW 1: BLOG UPLOAD & ANALYSIS (The Auditor)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This workflow handles the raw ingestion of content. It converts files into readable text and performs a comprehensive audit.

1. Input (File Upload/Webhook)
   - Function: Accepts file uploads (.txt, .doc, .docx, .html).
2. Edit Fields & Format Converter
   - Function: Sanitizes the input and converts binary file data into plain text for the AI to process.
3. Switch / Router Node
   - Function: The "Brain" of model selection. Based on user preference, it routes the text to Gemini, Grok, or ChatGPT.
4. AI Agent (Analysis Mode)
   - Function: Scans the text to extract "Vitals": Perspective (1st/3rd person), Tone, SEO Score, Current Keywords, and Structural Weaknesses.
5. Code Node (Parser)
   - Function: Structures the AI's analysis into a JSON object to be displayed on the frontend dashboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW 2: BLOG TITLE & METADATA UPDATE (The Quick Fix)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Designed for lightweight optimization. It focuses solely on the "clickability" and search visibility of the post without altering the body content.

1. Webhook (Trigger)
   - Function: Receives the current blog title and summary.
2. AI Agent (SEO Specialist Mode)
   - Function: Generates 12 variations of optimized H1 Titles, Meta Titles, and Meta Descriptions. It ensures keywords are placed at the front of tags for higher click-through rates (CTR).
3. Switch Node (Multi-Model)
   - Function: Allows the user to switch models to see how different AIs write headlines (e.g., asking Grok for "witty" titles vs. Gemini for "SEO-safe" titles).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW 3: COMPLETE BLOG UPDATE (The Heavy Lifter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This workflow performs a full surgical rewrite of the content. It preserves the original intent but upgrades the execution.

1. Webhook (Trigger)
   - Function: Receives the full body text and the "Analysis Data" from Workflow 1.
2. AI Agent (Editor Mode)
   - Function: Rewrites the article section-by-section. It improves sentence flow, fixes passive voice, injects missing keywords, and restructures headers (H2/H3) for better readability.
3. Context Preservation Logic
   - Function: Ensures the "Voice" and "Perspective" detected in Workflow 1 are maintained in the rewrite, so the blog doesn't sound robotic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW 4: ENHANCEMENT & CHATBOT LOOP (The Refiner)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A distinct workflow for micro-optimizations. It powers the interactive chatbot on the frontend.

1. Webhook (Chat Input)
   - Function: Takes a specific user request (e.g., "Make this paragraph funnier" or "Give me 3 more title options").
2. AI Agent (Conversational Mode)
   - Function: Executes the specific instruction on a small fragment of text.
3. Response Node
   - Function: Delivers instant feedback to the UI, allowing the user to iterate on specific sentences until they are perfect.
