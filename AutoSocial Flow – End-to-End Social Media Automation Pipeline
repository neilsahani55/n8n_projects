PROJECT NAME:
AutoSocial Flow – End-to-End Social Media Automation Pipeline

==============================================================================
1. PROJECT EXPLANATION
==============================================================================

AutoSocial Flow is a comprehensive automation engine built on n8n that streamlines the entire social media content creation lifecycle. Designed to eliminate manual repetition, this system transforms basic user inputs (Company Name, Description, and Keywords) into fully optimized, ready-to-post content for six major platforms simultaneously.

The system utilizes Google Gemini as the central intelligence to craft SEO-friendly captions, hashtags, and creative direction. It then autonomously generates platform-specific visuals, organizes all assets in Google Drive, and logs a complete history of the operation in Google Sheets. It effectively replaces the need for manual copywriting, image design, and file management, functioning as a "headless" social media agency.

2. WORKFLOW NODE BREAKDOWN
==============================================================================

Below is the technical explanation of the nodes used in the n8n workflow, following the execution path from start to finish.

--- A. INGESTION & INTELLIGENCE ---

1. Webhook (Trigger)
   - Function: Acts as the entry point for the workflow. It receives data (Company Name, Description, Keywords) via a POST request from the custom frontend UI.

2. AI Agent (Google Gemini)
   - Function: The "Brain" of the operation. Connected to the Google Gemini Chat Model, this node processes the user input to generate distinct captions, hashtag strategies, and image prompts tailored for every specific social platform.

3. Code in JavaScript
   - Function: Data Processing. It takes the raw, bulk text response from the AI Agent and parses it into structured JSON data, separating the content for Instagram, LinkedIn, X, etc., so they can be processed individually.

--- B. PARALLEL PROCESSING BRANCHES ---
(The workflow splits into 6 parallel paths, one for each platform: Instagram, Facebook, X, Threads, LinkedIn, YouTube)

4. [Platform] Generate Image Nodes
   - (Labeled: Instagram, Facebook, X, Thread, LinkedIn, Youtube)
   - Function: These nodes use the image prompts generated by the AI Agent to create unique, platform-optimized visuals (e.g., square for Instagram, landscape for YouTube) using an AI image generation model.

5. [Platform] Upload File Nodes (Google Drive)
   - (Labeled: Instagram1, Facebook1, X1, Thread1, LinkedIn1, Youtube1)
   - Function: Immediately uploads the newly generated images to specific folders within Google Drive. This ensures that every piece of content is backed up and organized by platform automatically.

--- C. AGGREGATION & STORAGE ---

6. Merge (Append Mode)
   - Function: Sync point. This node waits for all six parallel branches to complete their tasks. It collects the text data and the new Google Drive file links from every branch and merges them into a single dataset.

7. Aggregate
   - Function: Consolidates the multiple items (from the 6 branches) into a single list to ensure the data is formatted correctly for the database entry.

8. Edit Fields
   - Function: Data Cleanup. Filters and renames the final data fields to match the columns in the Google Sheet, ensuring a clean database entry.

9. Append or Update Row in Sheet (Google Sheets)
   - Function: The History Log. It writes a new row into a master Google Sheet containing the timestamp, input keywords, generated captions, and direct links to the created images on Drive.

10. Respond to Webhook
    - Function: Final Output. Sends a confirmation response back to the frontend UI, allowing the user to see the generated content and successful status instantly.
